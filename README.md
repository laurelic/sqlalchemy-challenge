# SQL Alchemy Challengs

## The Challenge
In order to plan a trip to Hawaii, use SQL Alchemy to query a weather database for historical data. The goal is to survey typical weather patterns during the desired dates.

### Step 1: Precipitation Analysis
Queries 12 months of precipitation data and visualizes rainfall in a line graph.

### Step 2: Station Analysis
Review the stations in the database and visuaize the temperature observations from the station with the highest number of observations.

### Step 3: Temperature Analysis
Plot minimum, average, and max temperature for the date range on a bar chart with error bar.

### Step 4: Daily Normals
Calculate the year-over-year daily normal avg, min, and max temperature for the date range and visualize in a stacked area chart.
